* CONFIG FILES
** /etc/dmscripts/config
This is considered the official global config file and we do not recommend you editing it. It will be overwritten if we change the configuration so you'll need to back it up if you modify it
** ~/.config/dmscripts/config
The first local config file is found here, this is free to modify and it is the recommended way to change the config file as it does not get overwritten. It is worth noting however that the config is still regularly modified so you will have to keep up to date on our gitlab page and read the diffs.
** Using the repo configuration
The repo can be used as is and provides a local config file. You can change it but it's change at your own risk. If you want to update the repo, for example, there may be merge conflicts. And when commiting, we expect a default config unless you are intentionally making changes to fix a bug or make an update and not to simply change something in a way you prefer.
** Using global variables
While we don't recommend it, you can choose to set some variables in other places such as the bashrc or the /etc/profile file. 
** Modifying the source
Finally, you can modify the source code to add more files to modify or to customize dmscripts to your heart's content, please report any bugs along the way however. Confirm it on an unmodified version first and read the issues.

* CONFIGURATION
** DMENU variable
DMENU is the default variable used in dmscripts, we expect all scripts to use DMENU in substitution of the dmenu command as we want our scripts to be accessible without modifying the source code. Currently DMENU is defined in a case statement which is used to define DMENU differently depending on the script.
** Other variables
A lot of the other variables are simply program names or directories and are not worth going into further details.
** Lists
Some our config is done in a list like format. There are two syntaxes, -A and -a. 

-A uses the format of:
#+begin_example
variable[name-displayed-in-dmenu]=what-it-actually-means
#+end_example

-a uses:
#+begin_example
variable=(
"thing1"
"thing2"
...
)
#+end_example
